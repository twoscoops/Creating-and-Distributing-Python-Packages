# Creating and Distributing Python Packages

Tracking issues and bugs for our [Python packaging courses](http://twoscoopspress.thinkific.com/collections/packaging) in the issue tracker.

Before You Submit an Issue
----------------------------

* Be nice. :-)
* Be honest.
* Check the other issues in [open](https://github.com/twoscoops/Creating-and-Distributing-Python-Packages?state=open) and [closed](https://github.com/twoscoops/Creating-and-Distributing-Python-Packages/issues?state=closed) to see if your issue already exists.
* Please, please, please identify each issue by chapter and section number. 
* For tracking and credit purposes, **each request for correction needs to be in it's own issue. If an issue contains 2 or more issues, we'll close it with a request for breaking up into more atomic issues.**

**Editorial Note:** In order to make issues more readily searchable, we will alter titles and descriptions of issues as needed.
