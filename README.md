# Creating and Distributing Python Packages

Tracking issues and bugs for our [Python packaging courses](http://twoscoopspress.thinkific.com/collections/packaging) in the issue tracker.

Before You Submit an Issue
----------------------------

* Be nice. :-)
* Be honest.
* Check the other issues in [open](https://github.com/twoscoops/Creating-and-Distributing-Python-Packages?state=open) and [closed](https://github.com/twoscoops/Creating-and-Distributing-Python-Packages/issues?state=closed) to see if your issue already exists.
* Please, please, please identify each issue by **section** and **lesson** number. 
* For tracking purposes, each request for correction needs to be in it's own issue. If an issue contains 2 or more issues, we'll break it up into more atomic issues.
* Please direct questions about pricing or availability to [courses@twoscoopspress.com](mailto:courses@twoscoopspress.com)
* Dirija sus preguntas sobre precios y disponibilidad a [courses@twoscoopspress.com](mailto:courses@twoscoopspress.com)

**Editorial Note:** In order to make issues more readily searchable, we will alter titles and descriptions of issues as needed.
